# OECM validation

Use designatedlands script with slightly different sources to identify areas that may qualify as OECM designations (protected-ish).

Repo contains `sources_designations.csv` versions and reporting queries.

## Usage

Run designatedlands.py script as per usual but point to `sources_designations.csv` held here.

## Reporing

Run `sql/designation_summary.sql` against the designatedlands db output table
